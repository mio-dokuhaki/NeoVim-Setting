# NeoVim-Setting
This is my NeoVim setting repo.
If you use this setting, make `init.lua` file under the `.config/nvim` directory.
Following the above, make `lua` directory (folder) under the same directory, and put files other than `init.lua` file.
Press Shift + P to import all the packages in `packer.nvim` and you are all set.
Then, You can import other packages as you like.
